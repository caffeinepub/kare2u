# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the share/publish button label and the ShareModal content to improve appearance, copy, or behavior consistently across the Header and Footer.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the share/publish button label/styling in both the Header and Footer components
- Update the ShareModal content (copy, layout, or styling) as needed
- Ensure QR code generation and clipboard copy functionality remain intact

**User-visible outcome:** The share/publish button and modal reflect the updated appearance and copy in both the Header and Footer, while QR code and link-copy features continue to work correctly.
