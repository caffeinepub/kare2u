# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a "Share Our Site" feature to the Kare2U website that displays a QR code and copyable link.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a "Share Our Site" button to the Header or Footer
- Create a modal or section that displays a client-side generated QR code pointing to the Kare2U website URL (using qrcode.react)
- Show the full shareable URL as readable text alongside the QR code
- Add a "Copy Link" button that copies the URL to the clipboard
- Style the modal/section using the Kare2U brand palette (light blue, soft green, white) with rounded corners

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open a share panel from the Header or Footer, view a QR code for the site, read the URL, and copy it to their clipboard with one click.
