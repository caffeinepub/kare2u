The 'For Adults' tab must show the 5 adult products (CalmCare Shampoo, CalmCare Conditioner, SootheSilk Body Wash, SootheSilk Lotion, RenewGlow Serum) with their full descriptions and exact prices. Each ProductCard must display: the product name, the full description text, the exact single price (e.g. '$12', '$22'), and the 'Add to Cart' button. Update the emoji fallback icons on ProductCard to be appropriate for each product type (e.g., 🧴 for body wash, 🫧 for shampoo, 🧴 for lotion, ✨ for serum). Ensure the adult tab grid accommodates 5 cards gracefully (e.g., last card centered or full-width on the last row).",
