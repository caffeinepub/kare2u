  "summary": "REQ-11 is largely implemented: a ShareModal component is created with a QR code (via Google Charts API), a copyable URL, and a Copy Link button. The modal is accessible from both the Header and Footer. However, the QR code is generated via an external Google Charts API rather than a client-side frontend library (e.g., qrcode.react), which violates the explicit constraint requiring client-side generation with a frontend QR code library.",

      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "QR code must be generated client-side on the frontend using a frontend QR code library (e.g., qrcode.react)",
      "reason": "The ShareModal uses the Google Charts API (an external third-party service) to generate the QR code image via a URL fetch, not a client-side JavaScript library like qrcode.react. The build request explicitly states 'QR code must be generated client-side on the frontend' and 'Use a frontend QR code library (e.g., qrcode.react)'.",
