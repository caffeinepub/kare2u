  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 fully. The ShareModal has been rebranded with improved appearance and copy ('Your Site is Live!' header, Rocket icon, dark navy header strip, live URL display, QR code, Copy Link button, Done button). The Header now shows a 'Publish' button (with Rocket icon) and mobile menu shows 'Publish Site', both opening the ShareModal. The Footer navigation includes a 'Publish Site' link (with Rocket icon) also opening the ShareModal. QR code generation via Google Charts API and clipboard copy functionality are preserved. No files under the protected paths were modified.",
