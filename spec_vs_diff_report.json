  "summary": "Both REQ-9 and REQ-10 are substantially implemented. The backend (main.mo, migration.mo) includes the Serum ProductType constructor and all 9 products with correct names, descriptions, categories, types, and prices. The frontend ProductCard and ProductCatalog components are updated with appropriate emoji fallbacks, price display, full descriptions, and a responsive grid layout. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
